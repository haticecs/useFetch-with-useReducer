# useFetch Custom Hook with useReducer

This is the simple implementation of useFetch custom hook with useReducer to fetch data in react App.

## Recall âœ¨

Inside src we have following folders.

```txt
src
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Posts.jsx
â””â”€â”€ hooks
|    â””â”€â”€ useFetch.js
â””â”€â”€ actions
|    â””â”€â”€ actions.js
â””â”€â”€ reducers
    â””â”€â”€ fetchReducer.js
```

### In the React docs it says useReducer accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.

``const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);``

#### So, we need reducer function in the useReducer and, it will be called as dispatch() in the component.

âœ… reducers stores reducer function that is defined as a useReducer's first argument.</br>
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ reducer taskes the action as parameter, and changes state accordingly via conditional (ex.swith-case) blocks. </br>
</br>âœ… actions stores action types in our case FETCH_INIT, FETCH_START, FETCH_FAILURE.</br>
</br>âœ… hooks store useFetch and it uses useReducer and useEffect to fetch data.</br>
